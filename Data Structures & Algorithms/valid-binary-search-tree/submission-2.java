     * Recursively validates whether the subtree rooted at `root` satisfies
     * the BST property, given the valid open range (minn, maxx) inherited
     * from ancestors.
     *
     * Why bounds instead of just comparing to immediate parent/children?
     * The BST property is transitive across ALL ancestors, not just the
     * direct parent. e.g. in tree [10,5,15,1,12], node 12 is > its parent 5,
     * but still invalid because it violates ancestor 10's constraint
     * (12 > 10, but 12 sits in 10's left subtree, so it must be < 10).
     * Bounds-passing carries that ancestor constraint down the recursion.
     *
     * Why `long` and not `int` for minn/maxx?
     * Sentinels must sit strictly outside any value a node could legally
     * hold. If we used Integer.MIN_VALUE/MAX_VALUE as int sentinels, a
     * single node whose actual value equals one of those extremes would
     * incorrectly fail the check (root.val > minn becomes MIN_VALUE >
     * MIN_VALUE, which is false). Widening to `long` guarantees the
     * sentinel can never collide with a real int node value.
